## 🎯 Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of a CSV analysis tool that allows users to upload CSV files, perform data analysis, and visualize results. The tool integrates with Google Cloud for enhanced data storage and processing capabilities.

## ✨ Features

- Interactive web interface built using Flask and HTML.  
- Data analysis and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.  
- Integration with Google Cloud for data storage.  
- Customizable and scalable for larger datasets.  
- Enhanced UI/UX with CSS for a polished experience.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Flask (Python)  
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas  
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib  
- **Cloud Storage:** Google Cloud Storage  
- **Dependencies:** NumPy  
- **Hosting:** Flask built-in server

## 🛠️ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.7 or above.  
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended).  
- Familiarity with Google Cloud Storage.  

### Steps  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/Kondareddy1209/CSV-Analysis-Tool-with-Google-Cloud-Integration
   cd CSV-Analysis-Tool-with-Google-Cloud-Integration  
   ```  

2. Download the dataset from Kaggle:  
   ```bash   

   Example dataset for Analysis of my tool
   https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamtapendu/crop-production-data-india
   unzip the data set.zip -d data/
   ```  

3. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn  

   ```  

4. Run the application:  
   ```bash  
   python app.py  
   ```
   For my Suggestion Use VS Code.


## 🚀 How It Works

1.Input: User selects a vegetable and location, then enters a desired date range.

2.Processing:
**Data is fetched from the cloud storage bucket.

**A machine learning model predicts prices based on the provided inputs.

3.Output: The predicted prices are displayed along with a trend visualization.

```
## 📊 Data Source  

Dataset: Users can upload their own CSV files for analysis.

Ensure your data is formatted correctly for optimal analysis.


## 📝 Sample Inputs  

- **Example :**  
  A sample CSV file can be found in the data/ directory.  

- **Example Output:**  
  The application will display various statistics and visualizations based on the uploaded data.
  

## 🎨 CSS Styling  

The web application uses a minimalist and responsive design. The CSS file located in `static/styles.css` ensures seamless interaction across devices.
Which includes just Background image and interactive page.

## 🌐 Live Demo

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Integration with APIs like TMDb or OMDB for real-time movie data.  
- Advanced recommendation algorithms (e.g., matrix factorization).  
- User authentication for saving preferences.  
- Deployment on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP).
